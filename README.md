# Discord-Bot
Discord bot with commands can be used in servers          
        
A friend's Discord server wanted basic commands like polling, quick GIFs, and coinflip/eightball for decisions, so I made this.
    
<strong>Uses Discord API and GIPHY API<strong>   

## Commands
- `poll`
- `eightball`
- `coinflip`
- `gif`
- `news`
